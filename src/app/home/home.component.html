      Comfort Works aims to breathe new life into all of the worldâ€™s living room; we do it by creating beautiful,
      handmade slipcovers that rejuvenate old and tired sofas. Every aspect of our operation is done in-house: from
      envelope design to web development to product manufacturing, nothing is outsourced.Comfort Works is where
      designers, geeks, writers, number crunchers, marketers, analysts, strategists, cat people, dog people, human
      people, manga lovers, movie lovers, gamers, introverts, extroverts and innovators who dream outside the box come
      together to help their fellow humans fall in love with their homes...over and over again.We design with the
      belief that we can live simple and beautiful by trying to revive the hidden potential of our old furniture and
      doing our part for the planet. Before we knew it, Comfort Works expanded into a huge range of products
      specializing in IKEA sofa covers, custom furniture slipcovers and other complementary accessories.
